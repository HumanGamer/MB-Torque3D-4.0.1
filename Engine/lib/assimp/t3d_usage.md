### Asset Import Library Usage Notes

No single set of default values will be appropriate for all import formats and many do not provide any metadata to draw the information from, so Shape Import Settings (.sis) files have been added as a way to save and reuse import settings. You can create default settings for each shape file type that you will be importing by setting all of the values in the import options gui and selecting `Save Settings`. Save the file in the default settings location (game/tools, editable in EditorSettings) using the shape file extension as the file name i.e. fbx.sis, blend.sis, obj.sis. Default settings files have been provided for gltf files.

Shapes can be re-imported via the Shape Editor by checking the `Source Art` box at the top of the inspector pane. Note: If the shape is currently loaded in the level, or is preloaded in any active datablock, the source art cannot be reloaded because the existing shape reference will not be released.
